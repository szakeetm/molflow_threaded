# Building (CMake)

All operating systems (Windows, Linux and Mac) now have their CMake configuration.

# Building (manual)
## Windows
* Open *molflow_win.sln* in the *Visual_Studio* folder, and use Visual Studio to build the solution.  
Tested with Visual Studio Community 2019.
* Update: With Visual Studio 2019's CMake support, you can now open the main folder containing *CMakeLists.txt* (File->Open Folder) and build the project
## Linux (Debian)
* Scripts in the *build_linux_debian* folder  
* Compile source files with *compile_linux_debian.sh* and link with *link_linux_debian.sh*. The resulting binaries are written in *bin/linux_debian*  
CMakeLists.txt / makefile coming soon.  
See *readme.txt*  for required packages to build.  
* Update: you can now build the project with CMake: run *cmake .* in the folder containing *CMakeLists.txt*, then run *make*. The resulting binaries can be run from the *bin* folder
## Linux (Fedora-based, like Cent OS)
* Scripts in the *build_linux_fedora* folder
* The *readme.txt* file in this folder contains more info
* You have to clone and build GCC 8.2 (or later) first.
* Before building GCC 8, you can configure an install directory (../configure --prefix=$GCC8DIR --enable-languages=c,c++ --disable-multilib)
* The compile scripts expect a GCC installation folder (with bin and lib64 folders), the location should be the default (*/usr/bin*) or defined by the *$GCC8DIR* environment variable
* Compile source files with *compile_linux.sh* and link with *link_linux_fedora.sh*. The resulting binaries are written in *bin/linux_fedora*  
* Update: you can now build the project with CMake: run *cmake .* in the folder containing *CMakeLists.txt*, then run *make*. The resulting binaries can be run from the *bin* folder
## Mac
* Use Homebrew to install build tools, like g++-8, the SDL2 library, libpng, gsl, curl, p7zip  
* The compile and link scripts are in the *build_mac* folder.  The resulting binaries are written in *bin/mac* 
* Compile source files with *compile_mac.sh* and link with *link_mac.sh*. The resulting binaries are written in *bin/mac* 
* Update: you can now build the project with CMake: run *cmake .* in the folder containing *CMakeLists.txt*, then run *make*. The resulting binaries can be run from the *bin* folder
 
# Running
## Windows
Use the shortcut (that changes the working directory and launches *molflow.exe*) in *bin\win\release*
## Linux (Debian)
* Install dependencies with the *apt* package manager, like *libsdl2-2.0*, *gsl-bin*, *libatlas-base-dev*  
* In the *bin/linux_debian* folder, make *molflow* and *compress* executable
* Run *molflow*  

[Detailed instructions here](https://molflow.web.cern.ch/node/296)
## Linux (Fedora-based, like Cent OS)
* Make *launch_molflow.sh* executable
* Run *launch_molflow.sh* (It adds the lib folder to the library search path and launches molflow)

[Detailed instructions here](https://molflow.web.cern.ch/node/302)
## Mac
* Use Homebrew to install dependencies, like *sdl2*, *libpng*, *gsl*, *gcc*  
* In the *bin/mac* folder, make *molflow* and *compress* executable
* Run *molflow*

# Repository snapshots
Commits are constantly pushed to this primary repo, and some of them might break - temporarily - the build scripts. If you want to fork Molflow, it is recommended that you download a [snapshot](https://molflow.web.cern.ch/content/developers) of a guaranteed-to-work state. Usually these snapshots are made at every public release of Molflow.
